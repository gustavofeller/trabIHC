An old style US highway sign, in .obj format. The main texture file has several layers, so you can have a rusty sign, or a brand new-looking sign. One
of the layers is blank so you can add your own highway number and state. Plus there's a transparency map - I don't know how to make a Mat file, so 
you'll need to add the texture and the transparency yourself. But since it's just a simple prop, I don't think that's too big of a deal. When you 
attach the transparency map to the transparency node, set your transparency value at 1, transparency edge at 1, and the transparency falloff value at .5  
and there you go.
